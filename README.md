# Research-Project-Netball
Performance enhancement and teamwork optimization in netball.

# System Overview
# Business Case
This project aims to revolutionize netball training for young players by providing an automated, affordable, and efficient solution to evaluate and improve their overall performance. By integrating machine learning (ML) technology, this solution identifies and analyzes key aspects of netball performance, allowing players, coaches, and umpires to train independently and effectively.
The system will evaluate players on four critical components: pass detection, hand signal recognition, technique analysis, and fitness evaluation via motor skills. This innovation addresses the gap in cost-effective and comprehensive training methods for netball enthusiasts and professionals.

# Problem Statement
The lack of comprehensive and affordable training solutions in netball often leads to suboptimal skill development. Training in all aspects of the game such as passes, gestures, techniques, and fitness requires significant resources, making it inaccessible to many players and umpires.
Current methods often involve high costs, manual assessments, and inconsistent feedback. This project aims to solve these challenges by offering a machine-learning-based automated system that evaluates and enhances performance accurately.
Inadequate Theoretical and Practical Integration: Players struggle to connect training techniques to gameplay scenarios.

# Goals
Develop an ML-based system to evaluate and analyze the performance of netball players in four critical areas:
Pass detection (Pass Accuracy, Patterns, and Detection).
Hand signal recognition and analysis (Gesture Recognition and Effectiveness).
Technique detection (Ball control, Footwork, Attacking, Defending, and Shooting).
Fitness evaluation through motor skills (Power, Agility, Speed, Balance, Reaction Speed, and Coordination).
Provide a cost-effective solution that ensures accessibility for young players and umpires.
Create a user-friendly interface for detailed feedback to help players enhance their skills independently.

# Deliverables
An ML model capable of:
Detecting and evaluating passes, gestures, fitness and techniques. 
A detailed performance report for players, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
A user-friendly application to provide real-time feedback and training suggestions.
Comprehensive documentation, including user guides and technical specifications.
Research findings on the efficiency and effectiveness of the system in training young players.

# Proposed Solution
An ML-based solution will automate the detection and evaluation of netball performance. The system will:
Analyze passes for accuracy, patterns, and efficiency.
Recognize hand signals and assess their effectiveness.
Evaluate techniques for key skills like ball control, footwork, attacking, defending, and shooting.
Measure fitness levels using motor skill tests like squats for power, zigzag runs for agility, and T-runs for reaction speed.
This innovative tool will offer young netball players and umpires a cost-effective and accessible way to improve their skills, paving the way for a brighter future in the sport. 

# Dependencies
Data Requirements:
Game footage for analyzing passes, gestures, and techniques.
Player performance data for fitness evaluation.
Hardware Dependencies:
Cameras and sensors to capture player movements.
Computers or mobile devices to run the application.
Software Dependencies:
Machine learning frameworks for developing models.
User interface tools for the application.
Target Audience:
Coaches, players, and umpires to validate the effectiveness of the system.
